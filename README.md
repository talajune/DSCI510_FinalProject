# DSCI 510 - Final Project


## Hello! Welcome to my final project for DSCI510. I will be analyzing country demographic data joined with the World Happiness Report ranking to draw conclusions about what factors seem to impact a country's "Happiness Score". I haven't decided which attributes to choose from for my visualizations and analysis, so I haven't dropped many of them from my code yet. More coming soon!




## Dependencies
A list of all of the dependencies used, included their version number
Preferably you should put this information in the requirements.txt file but please list it here as well

## Installation
How to install the requirements necessary to run your project:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the project
Typically, a single file is called to run the project (something along the lines of)

python code/main.py

## Methodology
What kind of analyses or visualizations did you do? (Similar to Homework 2 Q3, but now you should answer based on your progress, rather than just your plan)

## Visualization
which visualization methods did we use
why did we chose this particular way of visualizing data
what insights are revealed through the means of this visualization
[Bonus] Did you do any advanced visualizations? Briefly describe how you do it, and why itâ€™s a great visualization

## Future Work
Given more time, what is the direction that you would want to take this project in?
