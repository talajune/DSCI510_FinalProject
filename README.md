# DSCI 510 - Final Project
Hello! Welcome to my final project for DSCI510. I will be analyzing country demographic data joined with the World Happiness Report ranking to draw conclusions about what factors seem to impact a country's "Happiness Score". I haven't decided which attributes to choose from for my visualizations and analysis, so I haven't dropped many of them from my code yet. 


## Dependencies

requests-file==1.5.1 \
pandas==1.4.2 \
numpy==1.21.5 \

## Installation
How to install the requirements necessary to run your project:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the project
A single file is only needed to run the project, which I have decided to be a Jupyter Notebook found at:
python code/main.ipynb

## Methodology
What kind of analyses or visualizations did you do?

## Visualization
which visualization methods did we use
why did we chose this particular way of visualizing data
what insights are revealed through the means of this visualization
[Bonus] Did you do any advanced visualizations? Briefly describe how you do it, and why itâ€™s a great visualization

## Future Work
Given more time, what is the direction that you would want to take this project in?
