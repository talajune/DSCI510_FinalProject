# DSCI 510 - Final Project
Research question: What are the some factors that correlate to a country’s happiness ranking?

I collected data from two sources:
 1)  One openly available dataset from 2015 called the “World Happiness Report” from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness) and 
 2)  using country demographic statistics from a country API (https://api-ninjas.com/api/country). 

My project aims to uncover and identify correlations and trends between a country’s demographic statistics (i.e. factors like infant mortality rates, internet users, region, and urban population) and its happiness ranking.The analysis method I used include correlation analysis using NumPy and Pandas, and creating visualization, like scatterplots, bar charts, and maps that show the relationship between a country’s happiness ranking and specific attributes.

## Installation
How to install the requirements necessary to run your project:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the project
A single file is only needed to run the project, which I have decided to be a Jupyter Notebook found at:
python code/main.ipynb

## Methodology
What kind of analyses or visualizations did you do?

## Visualization
which visualization methods did we use
why did we chose this particular way of visualizing data
what insights are revealed through the means of this visualization

## Future Work
Given more time, what is the direction that you would want to take this project in?
